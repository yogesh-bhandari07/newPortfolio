            Yep, it's that simple: no payment until you see the site. The
            benefit? No worrying about paying for something you dislike. But
            obviously, if you don't pay, you don't get the site. This won't be
            an issue though because once you see the site, the last thing on
            your mind is not paying for it ðŸ˜‰. But why do this? From my
            experience, people are pretty skeptical when a 16 year old offers to
            make their site so this feature will keep you from worrying about
            paying for something you don't like!
